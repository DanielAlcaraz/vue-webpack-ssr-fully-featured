# Getting Started

First of all take a quick look at `Project Overview`.

Next I suggest you to get familiar with a few terms that are going to be used in this project by reading the `Glossary`.

We recommend the usage of yarn, but npm is fine too.

* Clone the repository

	git clone $URL
	cd $FOLDER
	```
* Install dependencies
	* Simply `yarn`
	* Or `npm install`

## Developing

* Starting the development instance
	* `yarn run dev`
	* Or `npm run dev`
* Testing
	* `yarn run test`

## In production

* Building for production
	* `yarn run build`
* Serving
	* `yarn run start`
