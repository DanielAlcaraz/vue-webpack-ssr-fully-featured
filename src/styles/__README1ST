Hey there.

Don't place CSS rules here. Only place Sass variables and mixins.

Never place any kind of code that produces output.

Place them in their respective component file, or inside `App.vue` if they are global CSS rules.

If you place any CSS rule here, the rules will be repeated in the output CSS every time you import them. Pretty sad.
